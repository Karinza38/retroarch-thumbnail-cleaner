# retroarch-thumbnail-cleaner
A simple bash script to remove unused thumbnails in RetroArch 🎮️

---
# Usage
In Linux terminal, navigate to the directory that the script is saved. Then:
```
./retroarch-thumbnail-cleaner "<RetroArch's main directory>"
```
For example, RetroArch (Flatpak) on my machine:
```
./retroarch_thumbnail-cleaner.sh "/home/archerallstars/.var/app/org.libretro.RetroArch/config/retroarch"
```
Depending on the size of the playlists, it might take a while to list all unused thumbnails.

# Why
There's a tool for this available on Windows, but not on Linux. So, I made this!
